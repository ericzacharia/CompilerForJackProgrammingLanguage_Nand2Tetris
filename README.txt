Project 11

Everything works.

ZachariaEricProject11.py is a program that reads in a folder full of .jack files and outputs an equal number of .vm files
in the same location as the input folder.


Output file will have the same file name and location as the .jack file in the directory path, with extension ".vm"

To run ZachariaEricProject11.py, type this on the command line:

On a Mac:
python3 <filepath>/jack_compiler.py <filepath>

On a PC:
python <filepath>/jack_compiler.py <filepath>
